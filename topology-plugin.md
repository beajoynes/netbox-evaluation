## Review

* Don't understand the filtering system, find it a bit rocky to use the plugin
* I reckon the display could be better :
* - Clearer icons
  - Add icons for WAN routers,  vspheres
  - Maybe have names with icons
  - Within rack display could be better
 * Want to add more data to understand/ explore better
 * Can download PNG of topology
 * Can rearrange by dragging - though they don't alweays stay where yo uwant, very 'floaty'
