When working in the office, some of the applications we have been looking at as part of the digital twin project will not work when using the office wifi (T-CORP or T-GUEST). 

Until the applications are allowed on the Telent wifi the main work arounds are to connect to :
- The point wifi (The building wifi, rather than Telent's wifi which is restricted)
- Your phone's hotspot
