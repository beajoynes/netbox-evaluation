Questions to ask NetBox


* NextBox UI Plugin - looks good but just not compatable atm, would Netbox take it on? : https://github.com/iDebugAll/nextbox-ui-plugin
* Can you reference sites etc by ID in UI? or is that API only?


* Security
* - Can you lock certain areas for certain people? I.e. minimise mistakes from accidental edits/ someone without the qualification editing wrong?
* What if two people edit the same info at the same time? Test this?
* branching plugin
  

Frontend?
*  Can you set up schemes and access them straight away? such that you can see for example the MMLite scheme and it's topology
* Site packs - creation, sharing
* idiot checks : flag up errors & rule creation?


* Make 'select all' choice for object type in custom field

* Explore project management tools for netbox
* - create and assign tasks or actions
  - scheduling
  - project reports - extract data from netbox to Qlik for reporting
